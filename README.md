📝 Problem Statement

Problem Statement Name: Personal Expense Tracker with Automated Bank Statement Analysis

Background

Managing personal finances is a universal challenge. Many individuals either:
Forget to log daily transactions,
Or cannot interpret their spending patterns effectively.
This often results in uncontrolled spending and a lack of financial awareness.

Our Solution

We built an Expense Tracker application that provides:
Manual Expense Logging – Users can quickly add daily expenses.
Automated Bank Statement Processing – Upload your bank statement, and the app automatically parses and categorizes transactions.
Data Visualization – Expenses are displayed through interactive graphs & charts, enabling users to make informed financial decisions.
This ensures that users have clear financial insights and can improve money management habits.
